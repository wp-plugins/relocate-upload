Wordpress uploads media to one pre-set folder. Relocate Upload lets you switch media to other folders.


== Description ==
Relocate Upload lets you specify folders, and adds a menu to the Media Library (and Edit Media admin page) that lets you switch media items between these folders and WPs default upload location.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the whole `relocate-upload` folder to the plugins directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Specify your folders in the settings page.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why? What's the point of these other folders? =

Most servers are setup so that assets can only be used when referred from your own site - to stop bandwidth leeching. However folders can be set aside that don't obey this rule - eg for placing images on other sites, downloading mp3s from RSS feeds and so on.

And how about plugins that have 'default folders', eh?

= It not work, fool =

That's not a question. Let me know on the [WP Forums](http://wordpress.org/tags/relocate-upload?forum_id=10#postform)  - i'm working on getting it from 'just about working' to a robust all-server plugin.

== Screenshots ==

1. A simple menu switches media assets to your favourite locations. All through the magic of AJAX.
2. A simple settings page to define the folder locations.
