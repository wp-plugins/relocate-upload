== Description ==
Relocate Upload lets you specify folders, and adds a menu to the Media Library (and Edit Media admin page) that lets you switch media items between these folders and WPs default upload location.

= It not work, fool =

That's not a question. Let me know - i'm working on getting it from 'just about working' to a robust all-server plugin.

== Screenshots ==

1. A simple menu switches media assets to your favourite locations. All through the magic of AJAX.

== What's the point of these other folders ==

Most servers are setup so that assets can only be used when referred from your own site - to stop bandwidth leeching. However folders can be set aside that don't obey this rule - eg for placing images on other sites, downloading mp3s from RSS feeds and so on.

And how about plugins that have 'default folders', eh?
